# Welcome to FlareLint

![What do you think of the logo? I drew it myself, can you tell?](logo.png)

FlareLint scans a [MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/)
project for
adherence to your style rules then display a report in your preferred
web browser. It's like picking the lint off your sweater, only more
fun.  Build projects faster and more consistently.

Use the FlareLint report to make sure that your content, and the rest
of your project, will give consistent output and won't delay
production. For example, FlareLint reports when a topic does not start
with an `h1` element.

FlareLint works independently of Flare. It inspects source files in
Flare projects directly and does not rely on Flare's output. FlareLint
does not modify your Flare project or its source files. You don't have
to open a project in Flare or build a Flare target before using
FlareLint.
