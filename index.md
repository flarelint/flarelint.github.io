# Welcome to FlareLint

Build [MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/)
projects faster and most consistently.

FlareLint scans your MadCap Flare project for conformance to your
rules then generates a report. Use this report to make sure that your
content, and the rest of your project, will give consistent output and
won't delay production. For example, FlareLint reports when a topic
does not start with an `h1` element.

FlareLint works independently of Flare. It inspects source files in
Flare projects directly and does not rely on Flare's output. FlareLint
does not modify your Flare project or its source files. You don't have
to open a project in Flare or build a Flare target before using
FlareLint.
